## INTRODUCTION

Customer segmentation is the art of breaking a company's clientele into discrete segments 
based on qualities and their preferences. It allows companies to learn more about their
customers, better their marketing strategies so as to better the overall experience. Through
identifying unique segments in their client base, e-commerce platforms deliver personalized 
content by conveying appropriate product recommendations which boosts customer 
satisfaction and improves company sales.

The validity of this problem arises from the enormous potential for e-commerce enterprises to 
obtain a gain competitive advantage in the market. Furthermore, customer segmentation 
allows companies to allocate their resources efficiently by targeting high-value segments, 
bettering marketing campaigns and maximizing the (ROI) return on investment.
